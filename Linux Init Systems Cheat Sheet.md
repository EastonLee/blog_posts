Easy way to tell which Init System you are using? And how to manipulate services in different Init System.

# Tell the difference of Init Systems

systemd, SysVinit, Upstart, Supervisor

You must have heard these terms and known their job is "start other process", but given a Linux system, can you tell which Init System it is using? And how to stop or disable service?

init is the first process run on Linux so it has pid=1. init keeps running as long as the system does. All other processes is started by init.

Earlier Linux distributions employed various Init System, but most latest distributions move to systemd.

# Supervisor looks simple, can it replace other Init System?

Brief answer: NO. Supervisor's biggest advance is its convenience, but it just covers a subset features which can be done better by like systemd or SystemVinit.
